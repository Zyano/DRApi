# DRApi
Api client to the danish broadcasting networks web api

## Functionality
The client is capable of accessing resources made publicly available through dr.dks web api.
Currently the client supports about 75% of the exposed methods with a large part of the unsupported functions being limited to 
either logged in users or internal use.

## Requirements
This project will only run on the aspnet core and is not designed to work on 4.5. 
That does provide the advantage of cross platform portability.
